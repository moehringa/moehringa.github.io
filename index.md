###ONE
* What Software Engineering Means to Me...
  * Software Engineering is the design, building, and ultimately creation of
  tools that can be used to enhance or boost the performance and/or quality of
  what they are being applied to.  Take for instance recommendation algorithms.  
  These algorithms raise the quality of the system to which they are applied by
  making recommendations or items to its users that they may not have know about
  otherwise.  The Software Engineering was the design and subsequent problem
  solving that took place to make automated relevant recommendations a reality.
  The engineers get to be the creators, making something from nothing, or redesigning
  an already existing project.  

###TWO
* _The Pragmatic Programmer_ Chapter 1...
  * During chapter one, the authors stressed the importance of being interactive
  within the working community, and communicating effectively with colleagues as
  well as clients.  One part that stuck out was "Good-Enough Software."  I know
  that its very easy to go somewhat overboard when finishing programs sometimes.
  Often more features are considered better when it may be true that by adding
  more we can actually be taking away from a program.  Good-Enough, it was stated,
  does not necessarily imply shoddy, but a product that works and does the job
  reliably.  
  * Another part I found interesting was the section when the author brought up
  the "broken windows" metaphor, and how important it is to pay attention to
  detail.  Although leaving something out or not fully refining a small detail
  may save a little time or energy, that small detail may imply a larger problem
  and snowball into more headaches down the road.  Having unfinished, or less than
  adequate pieces also gives off the impression that you may not care about the
  project, position, or job.
  * Finally, reading some of the timelines such as "read a technical book once per
  quarter," and "learn a new language each year" were good to give an idea of the
  expectations in the industry.  Also to start learning the new language this week
  was good as its easy to put it off and make the excuse of being to busy all of
  the time.
